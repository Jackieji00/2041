PROBLEM 1: concat_all and match/with
====================================

(A)
~~~

  Examine the code provided in `concat_all.ml'
  ,----
  | let rec concat_all_crap strlist =
  |   if strlist=[] then
  |     ""
  |   else
  |     let head = List.hd strlist in
  |     let tail = List.tl strlist in
  |     let rest = concat_all_crap tail in
  |     head ^ " " ^ rest
  | ;;  
  | 
  | let rec concat_all_good strlist =
  |   if strlist=[] then
  |     ""
  |   else
  |     let head = List.hd strlist in
  |     let tail = List.tl strlist in
  |     if tail=[] then
  |       head
  |     else
  |       let rest = concat_all_good tail in
  |       head ^ " " ^ rest
  | ;;
  `----

  Two functions are present which perform a similar operation but their
  output varies subtly.

  - Describe what the functions do.
  - Execute both functions on the following inputs in a REPL and paste
    the results below.
    - []
    - ["Fold-em"]
    - ["Muh";"muh"]
    - ["P"; "p"; "p"; "poker"; "face"]
  - Describe the difference in return value between the two
    functions. Pay particular attention to the ends of the strings.

------
Both of these two function convert string array to string.
REPL:
# concat_all_good [];;
- : string = ""
# concat_all_crap [];;
- : string = ""
# concat_all_crap ["Fold-em"];;     
- : string = "Fold-em "
# concat_all_crap ["Muh";"muh"];;
- : string = "Muh muh "
# concat_all_crap ["P"; "p"; "p"; "poker"; "face"];;
- : string = "P p p poker face "
# concat_all_good ["Fold-em"];;
- : string = "Fold-em"
# concat_all_good ["Muh";"muh"];;
- : string = "Muh muh"
# concat_all_good ["P"; "p"; "p"; "poker"; "face"];;
- : string = "P p p poker face"
Difference:
concat_all_crap has extra space in the end.

(B)
~~~

  Create a function `concat_all' which operates the same way that
  `concat_all_good' does but uses PATTERN MATCHING via the match/with
  construct.  Paste your code below and the results of testing it in a
  REPL.

----------
let concat_all strlist =
  let rec helper strlist =
    match strlist with
    | [] -> ""
    | head ::[]-> head
    | head :: tail-> head ^ " " ^ helper tail
  in helper strlist
;;

REPL:
# concat_all [];;
- : string = ""
# concat_all ["Fold-em"];;
- : string = "Fold-em"
# concat_all ["Muh";"muh"];;
- : string = "Muh muh"
# concat_all ["P"; "p"; "p"; "poker"; "face"];;
- : string = "P p p poker face"


PROBLEM 2: colsum and the stack
===============================

(A)
~~~

  Analyze the code in `colsum.ml'. It contains a function called
  `colsum_nt' which computes a certain sequence of numbers and sums the
  sequence.

  This file can be compiled and run as a program which will perform
  `colsum_nt 10' and print some intermediate and final results. Paste
  the lines you use to compile and run the `colsum.ml' below as well as
  the output for the program.


(B)
~~~

  Consider the source code for `colsum_nt'
  ,----
  |  1  let rec colsum_nt n =
  |  2    Printf.printf "%d\n" n;
  |  3    if n = 1 then
  |  4      1
  |  5    else
  |  6      let next = 
  |  7        if n mod 2 = 0 
  |  8        then n/2
  |  9        else 3*n+1
  | 10      in
  | 11      let rest = colsum_nt next in
  | 12      n + rest
  | 13  ;;
  | 14  
  | 15  let sum = colsum_nt 10 in
  | 16  Printf.printf "sum: %d\n" sum;
  | 17  ;;
  `----

  The `colsum_nt' function is NOT tail recursive. This means it builds a
  sequence of activation records as it recurses at line 11 until it
  reaches the base case at line 4. The initial call is `colsum_nt 10'
  and the first few frames of this sequence of activation records are
  below. Add on to this table to show all Activation Records present
  when line 4 is first reached in `colsum_nt'.

  ----------------------
   FRAME      SYM   VAL 
  ----------------------
   init       ...   ..  
   line:15    sum   ??  
  ----------------------
   colsum_nt  n     10  
   line:11    next  5   
              rest  ??  
  ----------------------
   colsum_nt  n     5   
   line:11    next  16  
              rest  ??  
  ----------------------
   ...        ...   ... 


(C)
~~~

  Programmers new to the idea of tail recursion may at times think
  trivial changes code re-arrangements such as the one below will make a
  function tail recursive. Notice in the `colsum_alt' version below how
  line 11 now has both the addition and recursive call.

  ,----
  |  1 let rec colsum_alt n =
  |  2   Printf.printf "%d\n" n;
  |  3   if n = 1 then
  |  4     1
  |  5   else
  |  6     let next = 
  |  7       if n mod 2 = 0 
  |  8       then n/2
  |  9       else 3*n+1
  | 10     in
  | 11     n + (colsum_alt next)       (* changed line *)
  | 12 ;;
  `----

  Explain why this version is still NOT tail recursive and in fact will
  execute identically to the previous `colsum_nt' version.


(D)
~~~

  Write a tail recursive version of `colsum' called `colsum_tr'. A good
  strategy for this is to use an internal helper function which takes
  some additional parameters beyond single value.  Paste your code below
  and show that it works identically to `colsum_nt'.
